    <h1>HELP</h1>
    <p>
      Guess the colours. In Beginner, you will play 4 possible colours and 10
      attempts. In Intermediate, you will have 5 colours to choose from and 8
      attempts. In Advanced, you will have 6 colours to combine and 6 attempts.
      With the available colours you must try combinations until you find the
      solution. When you press the check button you will see how many colours
      you have found in the correct spot (marked with purple balls) and how many
      colours you got right, but in the wrong spot (marked with white balls).
      Good luck!
